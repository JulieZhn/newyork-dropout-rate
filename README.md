# Data shows that former English learners are more resilient in staying in school than native English speakers 📚👨🏻‍🎓👩🏽‍🎓🎒🏫✏️🎨
### This project seeks to deepen our understanding of how being an English Language Learner and facing economic disadvantages may impact the dropout rates in New York City, as well as exploring broader reasons for dropout rates across the nation. 
Data shows the dropout rates of the cohorts enrolled in a four-year high school program and were scheduled to graduate in June 2019 (lastest available data).

From data analysis, here are **my findings**:

- Over the span of eleven years since 2010, the national high school dropout rate has shown a consistent decline. In 2020, it stood at 8.3%, dropping notably to 5.2% in 2021.
- The Bronx has the highest high school dropout rate among all boroughs in New York City in 2019.
- The Bronx has the lowest ELL high school dropout rate but the highest non-ELL dropout rate in NYC in 2019. The ELL high school dropout rate in Manhattan in 2019 is much higher than in other boroughs.
- The Bronx has the largest disparity in high school dropout percentage rates between economically disadvantaged and non-disadvantaged students.
- Interestingly, non-economically disadvantaged students have a higher dropout rate than economically disadvantaged students in Queens.

**Data Analysis**:
I created several tabels with the columns I want from the big datasets, and then I put the table into Datawrapper to make the map and charts.
